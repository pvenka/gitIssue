##Github open issue display by time

I used the git api to get information on the open issues.

I am using a form to get the company and repo on which the stats are required.

If the number of issues is more than 100 then pagination is required to get all the issues.

I have also provided a check to see if a  valid company name and repo name are used. 

*One can improve this further by maybe plotting the no of issues. One can also split by types of issue based on topics etc.

One can also get data over all the repos of a company to get cumulative stats. 

One can see how long an issue remains opem. At what frquency an issue is closed etc.*
